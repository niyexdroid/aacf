# Testing the Real-Time Logging System

## Quick Start

1. **Deploy the changes** to your production environment
2. **Login as admin** at `/admin`
3. **Navigate to Performance Dashboard** at `/admin/performance`
4. **Scroll down** to the "Real-Time Logs" section

## What You Should See Immediately

### Startup Logs

When the server starts, you'll see:

```
ℹ️ [HH:MM:SS] Logger initialized
```

### Cache Operations (as you browse)

```
💾 [HH:MM:SS] Cache MISS: blogs:1:10:all
💾 [HH:MM:SS] Cache SET: blogs:1:10:all
💾 [HH:MM:SS] Cache HIT: blogs:1:10:all  ← Good! Cache is working
```

### Database Queries

```
🗄️ [HH:MM:SS] SELECT on Blog (45ms)
🗄️ [HH:MM:SS] INSERT on Blog (12ms)
🗄️ [HH:MM:SS] SELECT on Event (23ms)
```

### API Requests

```
🔌 [HH:MM:SS] GET /api/blogs - 200    ← Success!
🔌 [HH:MM:SS] POST /api/blogs - 201   ← Created!
🔌 [HH:MM:SS] GET /api/blogs - 500    ← Error! (investigate)
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Test Cache Performance

**Goal**: Verify cache is working and see hit/miss ratio

1. Go to Performance Dashboard
2. Filter logs by "Cache"
3. Visit the blog page (`/blog`)
4. **First visit** should show:
   - ❌ Cache MISS: blogs:1:10:all
   - 💾 Cache SET: blogs:1:10:all
5. **Refresh the page** within 5 minutes should show:
   - ✅ Cache HIT: blogs:1:10:all
6. **Check the badge**: Cache count should increase with each operation

**Expected Result**:

- First load = MISS + SET
- Subsequent loads = HIT
- Badge shows total cache operations

### Scenario 2: Monitor Database Performance

**Goal**: Identify slow queries

1. Go to Performance Dashboard
2. Filter logs by "Database"
3. Browse different pages (events, blog, gallery)
4. **Watch for query times**:
   - 🟢 Green zone: < 50ms (excellent)
   - 🟡 Yellow zone: 50-100ms (acceptable)
   - 🔴 Red zone: > 100ms (needs optimization)

**Expected Result**:

- Most queries should be < 50ms (thanks to indexes!)
- Complex queries may be 50-100ms
- If you see > 100ms consistently, note the table name

### Scenario 3: Track API Performance

**Goal**: Monitor endpoint response times

1. Go to Performance Dashboard
2. Filter logs by "API"
3. Use the admin features (create blog, upload image)
4. **Watch response times**:
   - GET requests: should be < 100ms (with cache)
   - POST requests: may be 100-500ms (database write)
   - Status codes: 200/201 = success, 4xx = client error, 5xx = server error

**Expected Result**:

- All successful requests show 200 or 201 status
- Response times are reasonable
- No unexpected 500 errors

### Scenario 4: Error Detection

**Goal**: Catch and debug errors in real-time

1. Go to Performance Dashboard
2. Filter logs by "Errors"
3. Try to trigger an error (e.g., submit incomplete form)
4. **Should see error logs** with details

**Expected Result**:

- Errors appear immediately in the log viewer
- Metadata shows error details
- Timestamp helps correlate with user action

### Scenario 5: Auto-Scroll and Auto-Refresh

**Goal**: Test real-time monitoring features

1. Go to Performance Dashboard
2. **Enable auto-scroll** (checkbox)
3. **Open another tab** and browse the site
4. **Switch back to dashboard**
5. Logs should update every 5 seconds
6. Auto-scroll should keep latest logs visible

**Expected Result**:

- Logs refresh every 5 seconds automatically
- New logs appear at the bottom
- Auto-scroll keeps you at the bottom
- Disable auto-scroll to read older logs

## Interpreting the Results

### Good Performance Indicators

✅ **High Cache Hit Rate**

- See many "Cache HIT" logs
- Fewer database queries
- Faster API responses

✅ **Fast Database Queries**

- Most queries < 50ms
- Consistent performance
- No timeouts

✅ **Healthy API Responses**

- Status codes 200/201
- Response times < 200ms
- No error spikes

### Warning Signs

⚠️ **High Cache Miss Rate**

- Too many "Cache MISS" logs
- Consider increasing TTL
- Review cache invalidation strategy

⚠️ **Slow Database Queries**

- Queries > 100ms
- Check if indexes are being used
- Consider query optimization

⚠️ **API Errors**

- Status codes 500
- Check error messages in metadata
- Review server logs for details

## Advanced Testing

### Load Testing

1. Use multiple browser tabs
2. Rapidly browse different pages
3. Watch log volume increase
4. Check if performance degrades

### Cache Invalidation Testing

1. Create a new blog post (triggers cache clear)
2. Should see: "Cache DELETE: blogs:\*"
3. Next blog page visit = Cache MISS → SET
4. Subsequent visits = Cache HIT

### Database Performance Comparison

**Before Indexes** (if you have old deployment):

- Blog queries: 150-300ms
- Event queries: 100-200ms

**After Indexes** (current deployment):

- Blog queries: 20-50ms ✅ 75-85% faster
- Event queries: 15-40ms ✅ 75-85% faster

### Clear Logs Test

1. Accumulate 50+ logs
2. Click "Clear Logs" button
3. Confirm deletion
4. All logs should disappear
5. New logs should start appearing

## Troubleshooting

### Logs Not Showing

**Check**:

1. Are you logged in as admin?
2. Is the server running?
3. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
4. Look for calls to `/api/admin/logs`
5. Check for 401 (auth) or 500 (server) errors

### Auto-Refresh Not Working

**Check**:

1. Browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Network throttling (should be disabled)
3. Try manual refresh button
4. Check if API endpoint is responding

### Too Many Logs

**Solution**:

1. Use filtering to focus on specific log types
2. Clear logs periodically
3. Reduce log limit in API call (edit performance page)

### Missing Expected Logs

**Reason**:

- Only instrumented routes log currently
- Blogs API is instrumented
- Other APIs need instrumentation (future work)

## Next Steps After Testing

### If Everything Works

1. ✅ Confirm cache is working (see hits)
2. ✅ Verify database is fast (< 50ms queries)
3. ✅ Check for any unexpected errors
4. ✅ Document baseline performance numbers

### Performance Optimization

1. **High cache miss rate**:

   - Increase cache TTL in route files
   - Cache more endpoints

2. **Slow database queries**:

   - Review query patterns
   - Add more indexes if needed
   - Consider database scaling

3. **Frequent errors**:
   - Check error metadata
   - Fix bugs causing errors
   - Add better validation

### Additional Instrumentation

Consider adding logging to:

- `/api/events` (events CRUD)
- `/api/gallery` (image uploads)
- `/api/admin/*` (all admin actions)
- Prisma middleware (automatic DB logging)

## Success Criteria

Your logging system is working correctly if:

1. ✅ Logs appear in the dashboard
2. ✅ Auto-refresh updates every 5 seconds
3. ✅ Filtering works for all log types
4. ✅ Cache operations are tracked
5. ✅ Database queries show timing
6. ✅ API requests log response codes
7. ✅ Statistics badges show accurate counts
8. ✅ Clear logs button works
9. ✅ Auto-scroll keeps latest logs visible
10. ✅ No console errors in browser

## Performance Impact Check

Monitor for:

- Server CPU usage (should be minimal impact)
- Memory usage (logs are limited to 500)
- API response times (logging adds < 1ms)
- No degradation in user experience
