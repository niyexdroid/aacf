# üöÄ IMMEDIATE PRODUCTION LOGIN FIX

## ‚úÖ What We Just Fixed:

1. **Added SESSION_SECRET to Vercel** - The environment variable is now set in production
2. **Created Admin Setup API** - Easy way to create admin user if needed
3. **Enhanced Error Logging** - Better debugging for future issues

## üîß Steps to Fix Your Admin Login:

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment

Your latest push should trigger a new Vercel deployment. Wait for it to complete (2-3 minutes).

### Step 2: Create Admin User (if needed)

Visit your production site and go to:

```
https://aacfoundation.org/api/setup-admin
```

This will:

- Check if admin user exists
- Create one if it doesn't exist
- Return the login credentials

### Step 3: Test Login

1. Go to: `https://aacfoundation.org/admin/login`
2. Use credentials:
   - **Email**: `admin@aacf.org`
   - **Password**: `admin123`

### Step 4: Change Password (IMPORTANT!)

After successful login, immediately change the default password for security.

## üêõ If Still Having Issues:

### Debug Endpoint:

Visit: `https://aacfoundation.org/api/debug`

Should show:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "database": "connected",
  "userCount": 1,
  "environment": {
    "SESSION_SECRET": true,
    "DATABASE_URL": true,
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  }
}
```

## üîê Security Notes:

- Change the default password immediately
- Remove the setup-admin endpoint after use (optional)
- The SESSION_SECRET is now properly configured

## ‚ö° Expected Result:

After the deployment completes, your admin login should work perfectly!
